# Creating Files

Now that we have some knowledge of what types are how to use variables, let's put it into practice.

Create a folder, you can call it whatever you want, but let's give it a descriptive name like `lesson-1-exercises`.

When you launch Video Studio Code, you'll be greeted with the *Get Started* welcome page.
Under **start** you will find an option to Open a Folder. We will use that option to navigate and select our newly created folder.

If you are not shown a welcome screen, you can go to File -> Open Folder.

You may notice the first tab on the left side of Visual Studio Code is opened automatically.
This is the ```file explorer```, which will be your navigating tool within your directory. 
You can create files and directories with it.

Let's create a file. Click on the new file icon next to your folder name within the navigation tab.
You will be given the option to name a file. Let's call it `exercise-1.py`. Remember, all Python files must end with `.py`.
