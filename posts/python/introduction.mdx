# So You Want To Learn Python

If you stumbled across this course, you have certainly heard of Python, the programming language that has taken the world by storm,
and you're probably interested in learning how to become a Python Developer. Perhaps you have your sights set towards a world of data science and machine learning,
or maybe you've always wanted to learn how to code, Python is the language for you.

But before you dive head first into the world of Python, let us take a few steps back.

# What Is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, multi paradigm programming language often touted as one of the easiest programming languages to learn.
In other words, Python takes you as far away from the "metal" as possible, while giving you, the developer, immense flexibility.
It's okay if you didn't understand any of that, this course will teach you Python and a lot of the technical jargon that comes with it.

Python can be found behind a lot of systems that we use today. It is the powerhorse of machine learning with incredible tools like 
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Python excels at working with data, which has become essential in the spheres of Financial Tech (Fintech) and A.I.
But it can also do anything from making games quickly with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) to building web applications with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

If you can dream it, there's an ecosystem built around Python to turn your it into a reality.

# What Makes It So Easy?

Well let's take a look at some Python code. Take a guess as to what this program does.

<CodeTitle name="example.py" language="python" />
```python 
print("Hello World")
```

If you guessed that it prints the words "hello world", you're well on your way to
becoming a Python developer! The ```syntax```, or the structure of the language, is fundamentally very intuitive.
The language reads very closely to English once you start associating certain symbols with words or phrases.

Compare this to a language like Java.
<CodeTitle name="example.class" language="java" />
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Even though both programs accomplish the same goal, Python, is **appears** much more approachable for those learning their first language.
Couple this with it's immense ecosystem of support, Python is a clear winner for many first-time programmers.

# But Looks Can Be Deceiving

Python bridges the gap between computer science and learning developers, but it can leave many holes to be filled.
The simple nature of Python's syntax does not make it a simple language.
Python is equally as capable as any other language out there yet it's "easier".

Too easy.

Often, people who are looking to learn Python aren't learning the fundamental concepts behind Python.
These concepts are universally shared across nearly all programming languages and are integral in the field of computer science.
With Python, you can simply brush these aside because they aren't immediately essential in writing Python.

But that's all most courses and tutorials will teach you, to write Python, but never how to think like a programmer.

And that's okay, not everyone needs to know the best search algorithm or Big-O notation. . . sometimes you just want to make cool things fast and easily.

But if you're looking to get your feet wet in computer science, data science, or fintech, and you're ready to start your career with Python, then you've already taken the most important step,
the first.

The rest of this course will be your guide as we jump straight into the deep end, as you **Learn Python Right**.

It will be difficult at first. You will be frustrated. But you will be rewarded with an understanding beyond Python.
